The Refugee Responsibility and Sustainability Index (RRSI) is a metric I devised that uses a country's economic-demographic indicators to calculate the level of responsibility it has to either absorb refugees or increase its contribution to humanitarian aid.
This project seeks to convert this project to code, and will allow the user to simply enter a country of their choice and see its level of responsibility.
